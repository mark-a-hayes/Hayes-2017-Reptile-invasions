Mark A. Hayes

Begun June 26, 2017

These datasets are from data downloaded from the Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System (www.eddmaps. org) website for reptiles in the United States. 
In this project, reptiles are used that have > 100 records listed in the dataset as of June 26, 2017. This resulted in 15 species and individual species datasets. 
The csv files downloaded from the EDDMapS site are considered the master files for this analysis and the naming convention is as follows: genus and species as a 4-letter acronym, followed by the date of download. For example, for Agama agama downloaded on June 26, 2017, the csv master file is named: “agag – 06262017.csv” 
Thus, 4-letter codes and names are, following the EDDMapS site:

agag - African redhead agama (Agama agama africana)
aneq - knight anole (Anolis equestris equestris)
ansa - brown anole (Anolis sagrei)
bavi - brown basilisk (Basiliscus vittatus)
